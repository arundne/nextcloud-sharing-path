## 0.7.2 - 2026-08-06

**Packaging fix — 0.7.1 could not be installed from the App Store.**

- The release archives were built on macOS, where `tar` stores extended attributes as
  AppleDouble `._name` entries and defaults to the pax format, which adds `PaxHeader/…`
  entries. `tar` hides both when listing an archive, but Nextcloud's PHP extractor writes
  them out as real files and then rejects the app with
  `Extracted app sharepath has more than 1 folder`. The build now sets `COPYFILE_DISABLE`,
  strips extended attributes and writes plain ustar archives.
- **The 0.7.1 archives also contained the app's private signing key.** The build copied the
  whole working tree and filtered by exclusions, and `certificate/` was not on that list —
  `.gitignore` keeps a file out of git, not out of the release. The archives were removed from
  the release page, the key was replaced and the old certificate revoked
  (nextcloud/app-certificate-requests). The key was never committed to this repository, and
  0.7.0 predates it. The build now works from an explicit allowlist of what belongs in an app,
  so nothing can leak in by default again.
- No functional changes; the application code is identical to 0.7.1.


## 0.7.1 - 2026-07-29

**Security fix.** Please update.

- The settings endpoints decided whether to write the instance wide defaults purely
  from a `type=admin` request parameter, which any logged-in account could send. A
  non-admin could therefore overwrite the admin defaults — including
  `default_sharing_folder`, which controls what is served without a share and could
  be pointed at other accounts' folders. Admin rights are now checked against group
  membership; a non-admin request for the defaults is rejected with `403`. Present in
  all upstream releases; reported against the fork before the first App Store release.
- Ship a second app id, `sharepath`, built from the same code base (see README)


## 0.7.0 - 2026-07-28

Compatibility release for Nextcloud 25 - 34, tested against Nextcloud 33.0.6 (Hub 26 Winter).
First release of the [arundne maintenance fork](https://github.com/arundne/nextcloud-sharing-path).
Version 0.6.0 is skipped intentionally: the AnotherFoxGuy fork already uses it, and Nextcloud
refuses app downgrades, so this release must sort higher.

- Fix `Internal Server Error` on every download since Nextcloud 33: the removed private class
  `OC_Response` was still used for the `Content-Length` header
- Stream files through the public OCP API (`IRootFolder` / `File::fopen`) instead of the private
  `OC_Util::setupFS` / `OC\Files\Filesystem` / `View` internals, so future core refactorings
  no longer break the download endpoint (range / multipart range requests still supported)
- Catch `\Throwable` instead of `\Exception` so PHP engine errors are logged to `nextcloud.log`
  instead of producing an anonymous 500 page
- Add the modern security attributes (`#[PublicPage]`, `#[NoCSRFRequired]`, ...) alongside the
  deprecated annotations
- Restore the `Copy sharing path` file action on Nextcloud 28+ (Vue files app): register through
  the `@nextcloud/files` v3 array registry and the v4 scoped registry (Nextcloud 33+), loaded as
  init script; German label `Sharing-Pfad kopieren`
- Replace removed `OC.getProtocol()` / `OC.getHost()` with `location.origin`; clipboard now uses
  `navigator.clipboard` with a legacy fallback
- Replace legacy `OC_User::getUser()` with `IUserSession` in the personal settings
- Load the files integration via the typed `LoadAdditionalScriptsEvent` (the legacy string event
  is kept for old releases)
- Fix deprecated `${var}` string interpolation (PHP 8.2+)
