# Two app ids are shipped from this single code base:
#
#   sharepath    what the sources declare — our own app id, published on the
#                App Store under this name
#   sharingpath  the original app id, generated as a variant so existing
#                /apps/sharingpath/... URLs can keep working should the original
#                App Store entry ever be transferred to us
#
# The generated variant also gets its own PHP namespace. Both apps can end up
# installed on the same instance (the old sharingpath is still present on
# existing setups), and two apps declaring OCA\SharePath\… would collide in the
# class loader.
